I explore the intersection of Chinese phonetics, cursive writing, and experimental typographic systems. My work spans font design, open-source learning resources, and phonograph-based input methods and scripts.

## Featured Projects

- **[Mingjian Caoshu Heiti](https://github.com/Gs-Linguashop/MingjianCaoshuHeiti.git)**
  Open-source sans-serif font for cursive Chinese under development. The pioneer and best of its kind (in my opinion). Greate for education, digitization, and daily use.

- **[Aww’s Cursive Chinese](https://github.com/Gs-Linguashop/cursive-chinese-learn)**
  Open-source cursive Chinese learning resources, updated weekly with pictures and instructional videos. Focused on systematic understanding for learners of Chinese cursive writing.

- **[Sino-Phonographics](https://github.com/Gs-Linguashop/sino-phonographics.git)**
  A phonetic writing system based on Chinese characters, creating a syllable alphabet (~1000 characters) from historic phonology. Supports phonographic rendering and experimental character simplification. Accompanied by supporting tools.

## Other Projects

- **[Rime-Gryihleng](https://github.com/Gs-Linguashop/rime-gryihleng.git)** – Input method for Old Chinese phonology.
- **[Phonograph Input Method](https://github.com/Gs-Linguashop/phonograph-type)** – Experimental input method using phonographic components of characters.
- **[Chinese Phonograph Alphabet](https://github.com/Gs-Linguashop/phonograph-alphabet)** – Extracts phonographs to form a general syllabic alphabet suitable for other languages.

I maintain these projects as personal explorations in Chinese writing systems, phonetics, and cursive design. Most repositories are open-source.
